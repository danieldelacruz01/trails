## Stretch Goals

*in order of most -> least preferred*


1.More than one trail available with different themes

* e.g. sculptures, trees, cafes


2.Varying difficulty levels

* in terms of pace (i.e. time limit or no time limit), recognisability of landmarks


3.Social Media login

* User can keep track of the trails they have completed and the time it took them
* Leaderboards show user's name and fb profile picture
* Upon arrival at a checkpoint, user can see all other people who have also been at that checkpoint


4.Points/challenges

* Users receive a specified number of points per trail completed
* Users receive badges for completing special challenges/reaching certain milestones


5.Selfie uploads

* Users can upload a selfie at each landmark as a kind of 'tag' that can be seen by anyone who visits that landmark at a later time


6.Custom trails

* Users can create their own trails and share them with friends


## User Stories
* As a local I want a novel/fun way to see landmarks I know in Wellington
* As a tourist, I want suggestions for places to visit in Wellington
* As a user, I want to be given clues or hints to where the next checkpoint is
* As a racer, I want to see the time it took me to complete the trail
* As a racer, I want to compare my final time to others in a leaderboard
* As an explorer, I want to choose whether or not I want to be timed
* As an explorer I would like to be able to stop at any point and resume the trail later
* As a user I want to know how difficult a trail is to complete (in terms of distance)
* As a user, I would like a reward at the end of a trail (e.g. 2 for 1 offer at cafe)
